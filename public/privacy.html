        <li><strong>Device and usage data:</strong> device model, OS version, unique identifiers, app usage, session
            duration, and crash reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment data:</strong> when you make in-app purchases, payment is processed by third-party
            providers; we receive only confirmation of purchase and receipt details necessary to provide the service.
